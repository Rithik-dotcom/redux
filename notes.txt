what is redux?
redux is a predictable state container for javaSript application

first principle : the state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
second principle : the only way to change the state is to emit an action, object describing what to do.
third principle : to specify how state tree is transformed, we define a pure reducer.

// Creating Action //

const BuyCake = "Buying_Cake";
function buyCake(){
return {
type: BuyCake,
info: "first redux action"
}
}

// creating reducers //

const initialState = {
numberOfCakes = 10
}

const reducer = (state=initialState, action) => {
switch(action.type){
 
case BuyCake: return{
...state,
numberOfcakes = state.numberOfCakes-1,
}
default : return state

}
}
